Tarball:
========
The source directory has been renamed from tls1.6.4/ to tcltls-1.6.4+dfsg and
then it has to be compressed using gzip -9 in order to comply with Debian
Policy.

dpatch:
======
The source package itself uses a mixture of dpatch and .diff.gz for the
modifications of the upstream source. If you want to change something it is
best to use the dpatch approach as documented in

 /usr/share/doc/dpatch/README.source.gz
